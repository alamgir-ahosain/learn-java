Getters and Setters in Java â€“ Key Points:
    1. Getters:Retrieve private field values, typically named get<FieldName>().
    2. Setters:Set or update private field values, usually named set<FieldName>().
    3. Control and Validation:Offer controlled access and allow for validation logic.
    4. Encapsulation:Facilitate read-only or write-only access to class fields.
    5. Flexibility:Allow for internal changes without affecting external interfaces.
