Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

Why use Abstraction?
Core principle:
    Abstraction hide complex implementation  details.focusing only on essintial feature.
Focus on Functionality:
    Emphasizes what an object does,not how to does not ,through clear Interfaces.
Simplifies complexity:
    it reduces complexity by showing only relevant information in class design.
Real-Word Modeling: 
    Abstraction alloes creating objects that represent real-life entities with key attributes and behaviours.    


How achieve abstraction in Java?
    1.Abstruct class
    2. Interfaces


abstract class ClassName {
    // Abstract method (doesn't have a body)
    abstract void methodName();

    // Concrete method (has a body)
    void concreteMethod() {
        // Method body
    }
}

1. abstruct keyword 
        1.1 Abstruct class
        1.2 Abstruct Method.
    1.1 Abstruct class
        i. Used to declare non-instatiable abstract .
        ii. Serve as base class or superclass.
        iii. Can have both abstract methods and non-abstract methods .

    1.2 Abstruct Method 
        i. Defines method without implementation,requiring subclassess to provide specific Functionality.
        ii. Subclass must implement all abstract method of an abstract class.
        iii. Allows for flexible class design by defining a constract for subclassess.

defining an Interfaces
implementing an interface
2. Interfaces
    i. An interface is like a contract — it declares methods that must be implemented by the classes that use it.
    ii. A class can implement multiple Interfaces.
    iii. All interface methods are by default public and abstract (unless they are default or static).
    iv. Interfaces can have
        abstract methods (no body → must be implemented)
        default methods (have a body → optional to override)
        static methods (can be called using interface name)




Is java allow multiple inheritance?
    In generally multiple class cannot be inherited in java.but multiple Interfaces can be.


Key Points:
    i. abstruct  keyword is a non-access modifier(access modifier are public,private ,protected ,default) 
    ii. implement
    iii. override
