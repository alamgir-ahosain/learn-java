               ________ FileWriter Class_____ 

    1. FileWriter is used for writing streams of characters to files.
    2. It's a character-based stream, which means it's best used for writing text rather than binary data.
    3. Constructors:
       1. FileWriter(String fileName): Creates a FileWriter object given the name of the file to write to.
       2. FileWriter(File file): Creates a FileWriter object given a File object.
   4.Common Methods:
       1. write(int c): Writes a single character.
       2. write(char[] cbuf): Writes an array of characters.
       3. write(String str): Writes a string.
       4. flush(): Flushes the stream, ensuring all data is written out.
       5. close(): Closes the stream, releasing any associated system resources.

                ___________FileReader Class_________

    1. The FileReader class is used for reading streams of characters from files.
    2. It's a character-based stream, meaning it reads characters (as opposed to bytes). This makes it suitable for reading text files.
    3. Constructors:
        1. FileReader(String fileName): Creates a FileReader object to read from a file with the specified name.
        2. FileReader(File file): Creates a FileReader object to read from the specified File object.
    4. Common Methods:
        1. read(): Reads a single character and returns it as an integer. Returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached.
        2. read(char[] cbuf): Reads characters into a buffer and returns the number of characters read.

                 _______________BufferedReader / BufferedWriter _____________
   1. Efficient Reading/Writing
   2. Wraps FileReader/FileWriter for faster performance.
   3. Reads/writes line by line instead of character by character.        
   4. method
        1. readLine() : Reads a full line (BufferedReader only) .Returns a String containing the line, or null if end of file.
        2.newLine() :Writes a platform-specific newline.

                    
                 _______________FileInputStream / FileOutputStream  _______________
   1. Binary Data (Images, Audio, etc.)
   2. Used for raw binary data like images, PDFs, audio, etc.
   3. Reads/writes bytes instead of characters.
   4. method
        1. read(byte[] b) :Reads bytes into a byte array, returns number of bytes read.
        2. available() :Returns the number of bytes available to read without blocking.
        3. write(byte[] b)	Writes bytes from an array.
        4. write(byte[] b, int off, int len)	Writes len bytes from array starting at offset off.
